# Homework Assignment #2: 

## Details:
 
1. Following the examples in the previous lectures, create a universal HTML structure template for your application.

2. Create a new route and template called /about, whose template inherits from the main structure. This route should respond to GET requests only, and it should always respond with 200.

3. On that /about page, create a title and a paragraph about yourself. Include any details that you'd like the world to know about you. The site you're building now will eventually be live on the web, and this will be your "About Us" page. If you'd rather make up a character (and keep your personal information private) go right ahead! We won't know the difference!

4. Add a profile picture (or your favorite avatar) on that page, and add a bit of CSS so the image is positioned next to the paragraph.

## Running the Application Locally
